* Help me improve the course
** We start with a emacs org-mode, this file is \verb+e0.org+.
** An Erlang program \verb+orgmode_parse.erl+ transforms it into \verb+lecture_e0.tex+. This adds color coding of code and a few other nice things.
** Run \verb+pdflatex+ twice and get \verb+lecture_e0.pdf+.
** This course is being continuously updated and is possibly buggy.
** Please help me improve the material. Push all changes to github.
** There are no course credits for helping.
** \textcolor{Red}{Tell me if the examples are too easy or difficult}. They should take N hours/week. What is N?
* Tell them how wonderful make is
** some student will do this

Problem 1 - fix Makefile.in or configure.ac to reduce output from pdflatex.
