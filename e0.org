* Help me improve the course
** We start with a emacs org-mode, this file is \verb+f0.org+.
** An Erlang program \verb+orgmode_parse.erl+ transforms it into \verb+f0.org.tex+. This adds color coding of code and a few other nice things.
** Run \verb+pdflatex+ twice and get \verb+e0.org.pdf+.
** This system was written last week and is possibly buggy.
** Please help me improve the material. Push all changes to github.
** There are no course credits for helping.
** \textcolor{Red}{tell me if the examples are too easy or difficult}. They should take N hours/week. What is N?
